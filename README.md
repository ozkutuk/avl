# avl
This is a generic AVL tree implementation in C, written for fun.
I wrote it in my not-so-free time instead of studying for an EEE class. I may keep
improving it when I have free time once in a while.
More information about usage and implementaion details will (may) come soon (or later).

# TODO
- Preorder and postorder traversals
- Document the usage a bit
- Think about the design a bit and make sure it won't lead to dead ends
